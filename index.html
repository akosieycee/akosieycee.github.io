                <h2>Software Development Student</h2>
                <p>I'm currently a student at The Coders Guild taking up Crucial Skills for Software Developers course. I started the course in July 2022, and I'm expecting to be finished by November 2022. I'm also doing FreeCodeCamp to learn more about coding and to help me build my portfolio during my free time. I'm looking to further my career into the Tech Industry and hoping to get a stable job in this industry.</p>
